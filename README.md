## Debouncing for Enhanced User Experience and Performance

Welcome to the world of Debouncing! This technique enhances user experiences and optimizes performance in your application. Let's delve into the details.

## Typing Speed and Debouncing

- Typing Slow: 200ms
- Typing Fast: 30ms

## The Problem: Unnecessary API Calls

Imagine a scenario where a user is typing in a search query. Without debouncing, the system might make numerous unnecessary API calls, causing delays and inefficiency.

### Performance Challenge: iPhone Pro Max

Consider an example involving 1000 users equipped with iPhone Pro Max, each typing 14 characters:

- **Without Debouncing**: 14 letters \* 1000 users = 14,000 API Calls
- **With Debouncing**: 3 API Calls \* 1000 users = 3,000 API Calls

Debouncing dramatically reduces the number of API calls, ensuring both a smoother user experience and optimal system performance.

## Debouncing in Action

But how does debouncing work? Let's break it down.

### Debouncing with 200ms

- If the difference between two keystrokes is less than 200ms, we refrain from making an API call, effectively declining it.
- If the time interval between keystrokes is greater than 200ms, we initiate an API call and display the results. This happens because the user has paused typing, and there's a higher chance they're seeking suggestions.

In essence, debouncing allows your application to intelligently wait for user input while maintaining a highly performant system.

## Conclusion

Debouncing is the secret ingredient that ensures your application is responsive, efficient, and provides a seamless user experience. By implementing this technique, you strike the perfect balance between showing results promptly and optimizing API calls, making your application a true performer.
